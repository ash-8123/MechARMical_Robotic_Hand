Software
-
Software needed for the integration of muscle sensors and servos for the articulation of the robotic hand

EMG Muscle Sensors
-

*IN PROGRESS - still in development!*

 Current/Intended process: 
 * Getting signals from the sensors (3 sensors placed on forearm)
 * Reduction of noise - more stability from the readings
 * Send the signals towards the servos

Servos
-
*IN PROGRESS - still in development!*

Uses: 
* FeeTech SCS0009
* Waveshare Serial Bus Servo Driver Board
* ESP 32 Development Board

 Intended Process: 
 * Servos are daisy-chained and connected to the Waveshare board
 * ID the servos
 * Test individual servos
 * Take translated signal from muscle sensors and output them into servo motion
