![Assembled Hand - Curled - Inside/Bottom View](/images/Hand_Position1.jpeg)

**MechARMical Robotic Hand - University Project - Work-in-Progress**

## Overview

Our Robotic Hand is built off the open-source project - [Robot Nanohand](https://robotnanohand.com/) - and augmented to translate input from EMG sensors. This project was made in a 11-week span under the ME 480 Advanced CAD course from the University of Washington.


The MechARMical Robotic Hand features:

* **Articulated movement** with FeeTech servo motors
* **Individual finger articulation** with non-linear motion
* **Teleoperation** via EMG muscle sensors

## Build Process

### Hardware

1. Manufacturing of individual parts
2. Assembly of hand, incorporating electronics

### Software

3. Servo software development
4. Integration of EMG muscle senors

## Project Status

**In Progress** - This project is being developed for a university course.
