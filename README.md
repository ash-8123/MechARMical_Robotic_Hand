# MechARMical-Robotic-Hand

## Overview

Our Robotic Hand is built off the open-source project - [Robot Nanohand](https://robotnanohand.com/) - and augmented to translate input from EMG sensors. This project was made in a 11-week span under the ME 480 Advanced CAD course from the University of Washington.

**Build specs:**

The MechARMical Robotic Hand features:

* **Articulated movement** with FeeTech servo motors
* **Individual finger articulation** with non-linear motion
* **Teleoperation** via EMG muscle sensors

## Build Process

### Hardware

1. Manufacturing of individual parts
2. Assembly of hand, incorporating electronics

### Software

3. Servo software development
4. Integration of EMG muscle senors

### Quick Reference

* **Bill of Materials**: Component List
* **Nanohand Open-Source**: Available in `/3D/` directory (OnShape CAD)
* **Software Control**: Software Repository using FeeTech

## Project Status

**In Progress** - This project is being developed for a university course.
